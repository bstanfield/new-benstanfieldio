  "content": "Friday marked my last day working on my own startup, Wren. I created the company in 2019 with my co-founders Mimi Tran Zambetti (now my fiancée), and Landon Brand. Over the years, we built a category defining and leading marketplace, raised venture capital from prestigious investors like Y Combinator and Union Square Ventures, hired employees, let employees go, acquired competitors, got (partially) acquired ourselves, and much more in-between.\n\nI will do my best to chronicle my learnings, and more helpfully my failings and shortcomings, across six years building a startup straight out of college. Frankly, I am doing this more for myself than you (or anyone who happens to read this), so I apologize for anything lacking context. If you have questions, please find me online.\n\n# Big topics\n- Starting a startup with your girlfriend\n- Surviving (and thriving) as a climate startup, despite a global pandemic and two Trump administrations\n- Bridging trust gaps through design, education, and clever marketing\n- Finding aligned investors and scaling to profitability (but not hyper-scale)\n- Bootstrapping a second product (Topos) inside of Wren, and selling it\n- Leaving",
