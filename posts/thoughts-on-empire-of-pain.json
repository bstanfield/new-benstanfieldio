  "content": "I recently finished reading Empire of Pain by Patrick Radden Keefe, on the history of the Sacklers, the family dynasty behind the opioid crisis in America.\n\nKeefe accomplishes a herculean task of chronicling the lives of three generations of Sacklers, from the progenitor, Arthur Sackler, who pioneered medical marketing and created Purdue Pharma, all the way through the lives of his grandchildren, and the many offspring of his brothers.\n\nThere are clear themes of the lengthy book—most obviously greed, corruption, and power. What struck me most, however, is a recurring problem of *self-deception*. None of the central characters of *Empire of Pain* ever admit wrongdoing or culpability for Purdue's role in the opioid crisis. Perhaps this is to avoid legal entrapment, or a display of stubbornness or pride. But I believe the Sacklers, and many of their associates, have completed deceived themselves into ignoring the facts of the crisis for which they bare much responsibility.\n\nIt is as if, after a person crosses a threshold where so much of their life and career is tied to a belief, it is near impossible to dislodge the belief for the truth.\n\nThis got me thinking about how I might be embodying any such beliefs myself — perhaps with the advent of artificial intelligence? Do I believe too much in the benevolent potential of AI, and should I be more critical of the possible downstream effects?",
