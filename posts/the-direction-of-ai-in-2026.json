  "content": "As always, take any prediction with a grain of salt. And anything pertaining to AI especially so.\n\nAnd yet, I will do my best to succinctly explain my perspective on AI in 2026—how to wield it, which companies will dominate it, and so-on—in a few paragraphs.\n\nFirst, a reflection on job loss, or lack thereof, thus far.\n\n\n\nKey thoughts:\n\n- Golden hour for Generalists. Many specialists will be left behind by rapid pace of change.  \n\n- Model commeditization is coming, faster than we thought. Use charts. \n\n- Big model companies are going to become big context companies, and enterprise software providers. See: Anthropic's Interviewer, OpenAI's app store, etc. (?)\n\n- Great Context Wars reach a fevered pitch in 2026. See: Google deeply embedding Gemini into GSuite, rapid advance of their market share.\n\n- \"Agentic AI\" doesn't work — re-focusing on killer Enterprise software that has familiar workflows, but are now AI-native with fantastic context-building feedback loops. Good callout potential for Outset.\n\n- Similarly, minimal chatbox UI's will display \"convergent evolution\" with web2 ... more filters, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc. that bring back control to the user. Could use crab analogy here.\n\n- Big winners: \n  - Excellent enterprise AI software that properly embeds AI and feedback loops into existing workflows.\n  - Google. Huge advantage in context wars. Will make a massive acquisition, perhaps of a Perplexity or Cursor.\n  - Generalists.\n\n- Big losers:\n  - Companies building directly in the path of model companies (i.e. Cursor going up against Anthropic's Claude Code)\n  - OpenAI  ... pioneer always ends up with arrows in their back. Lawsuits, commoditization eating into costs, losing battle against Google's context advantages.\n  - Traditional knowledge centers like Wikipedia, Reddit, and Stack Overflow :(",
