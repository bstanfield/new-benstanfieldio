And anything pertaining to AI especially so.\n\nAnd yet, I will do my best to succinctly explain my perspective on AI in 2026—how to wield it, which companies will dominate it, and so-on—in a few paragraphs.\n\nFirst, a reflection on job loss, or lack thereof, in the US economy due to AI: The results are mixed, and it seems job *growth* due to AI in some sectors offsets single-digit *loss* in others. Most jobs are seeing *augmentation* by AI, and I see that continuing and intensifying in 2026.\n\n### Golden Hour for Generalists\nWhile many jobs might not be going *away*, grounds for promotion and excellence are shifting away from siloed skills and toward generalization, super-charged by competent use of AI tools. For example, a good product designer that can code (with the mastery of AI coding tools like Claude Code and Cursor) is more valuable than a great product designer that cannot.\n\nThese cross-functional \"unicorns\" used to be rare, but mastery of AI tools can quickly increase core competencies.\n\nI predict cross-functional Generalists to flourish in 2026, aided by AI tool-use to accelerate their learning.\n\n### Agentic AI loses to AI Enterprise Workflows\nFor the past several years, companies have tossed chatbot subscriptions their employees with the hope that these general-purpose tools will enable instant productivity gains.\n\nIn reality, most of these pilots failed because general-purpose, agentic systems lack the context and familiar workflow touch-points (spreadsheets, emails, slack) to drive adoption and productivity increases.\n\nInstead, I believe narrower, vertical-specific, and context-rich software will dominate successful AI Enterprise rollouts in 2026.\n\nCounterintuitively, successful AI applications for Enterprise will look less like ChatGPT, and more like Excel.\n\n### Google closes gap with OpenAI\nGemini is really good. But, Google's data about you, as well as its massive product ecosystem (Search, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Docs, Sheets), allows for deployment of Gemini-powered AI assistance, with rich context, at nearly every digital work touch-point.\n\nConversely, OpenAI and Anthropic lack significant product ecosystems beyond the basic chat interfaces for ChatGPT and Claude.\n\nAs frontier model benchmarks plateau and models become mostly a commodity, the winner of the AI Race will be the model provider with the strongest product moat.\n\nIt will be much easier to convince a Google Chrome user to adopt Google Gemini, than a ChatGPT user to adopt a new OpenAI-built browser.\n\nAnd lastly, Google owns their own chip architecture, will reduces their reliance on expensive NVIDIA chips, and vertically integrates much of the development and deployment of Gemini models.\n\nMy prediction here is straightforward: Google will continue to ride these tailwinds and close the gap on OpenAI.\n\n### AI Labs become Product Companies\nAnthropic and OpenAI will ship a staggering amount of products in 2026—web browsers, coding assistants, app stores, customer support, research, education—to mitigate the \"context gap\" presented by Google's existing product ecosystem.\n\nConsequently, companies building directly in these verticals, like Cursor \n\n\n\nKey thoughts:\n\n- Golden hour for Generalists. Many specialists will be left behind by rapid pace of change.  \n\n- Model commeditization is coming, faster than we thought. Use charts. \n\n- Big model companies are going to become big context companies, and enterprise software providers. See: Anthropic's Interviewer, OpenAI's app store, etc. (?)\n\n- Great Context Wars reach a fevered pitch in 2026. See: Google deeply embedding Gemini into GSuite, rapid advance of their market share.\n\n- \"Agentic AI\" doesn't work — re-focusing on killer Enterprise software that has familiar workflows, but are now AI-native with fantastic context-building feedback loops. Good callout potential for Outset.\n\n- Similarly, minimal chatbox UI's will display \"convergent evolution\" with web2 ... more filters, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc. that bring back control to the user. Could use crab analogy here.\n\n- Big winners: \n  - Excellent enterprise AI software that properly embeds AI and feedback loops into existing workflows.\n  - Google. Huge advantage in context wars. Will make a massive acquisition, perhaps of a Perplexity or Cursor.\n  - Generalists.\n\n- Big losers:\n  - Companies building directly in the path of model companies (i.e. Cursor going up against Anthropic's Claude Code)\n  - OpenAI  ... pioneer always ends up with arrows in their back. Lawsuits, commoditization eating into costs, losing battle against Google's context advantages.\n  - Traditional knowledge centers like Wikipedia, Reddit, and Stack Overflow :(",
