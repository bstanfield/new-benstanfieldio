  "content": "For decades, the \"digital canvas\" has been the commonly accepted medium of the visual design of software.\n\nThe type of canvas has changed—Photoshop, Illustrator, InVision, and most recently Figma—but the rationale is the same: The canvas provides an open space for the exploration of  new design concepts.\n\nHowever, most software, especially modern software, are dynamic systems, and canvases limit designers to a static realm.\n\nCompare a designer's static canvas file to a software engineer's code repository, and while they are effectively describing the same system, the differences are significant. While the engineer can write code that creates a dynamic system, the designer cannot.\n\nNew advances in AI prototyping tools ...\n\n\nIdea for this post: Modern design/product teams love to shit on Figma, say static mocking is done and now everyone can work in code. But there is a time and place for both, and there is a lot of nuance in picking the right tools at this moment in time. Still the Wild West.\n\nWould like to write about workflow using:\n- Figma\n- Cursor\n- Maybe something new like Desn?\n- Maybe a Lovable? idk.\n\nReference vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J08endIde9E",
