  "content": "For decades, the \"canvas\" has been the unassailable medium for the visual design of software.\n\nThe renderer of the canvas changes—Photoshop, Illustrator, \n\n\nIdea for this post: Modern design/product teams love to shit on Figma, say static mocking is done and now everyone can work in code. But there is a time and place for both, and there is a lot of nuance in picking the right tools at this moment in time. Still the Wild West.\n\nWould like to write about workflow using:\n- Figma\n- Cursor\n- Maybe something new like Desn?\n- Maybe a Lovable? idk.\n\nReference vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J08endIde9E",
